I&#8217;ve held a few leadership positions in my life, even if I&#8217;m more of a &#8220;support others&#8221; type of person. One of the ways that I have helped is by leading a group of international students at my university called &#8220;Phi Beta Delta&#8221;.

It is always tough living in another country, so it was great to be able to organize people and make sure that they had a community.  It was also an amazing learning experience for me to learn about the way a university club is run and the details of budgets and trying to please my constituents.  Because our society had voting rights on the student council, I had a large responsibility to represent international students.  Our school council was generally focused on student life and international students didn&#8217;t benefit from most of the events.  When I lived in Russia as a student, I didn&#8217;t feel very much like part of the school at large and it was great to be able to push for that at my home university.
