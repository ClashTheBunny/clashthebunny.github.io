I do love flavor. There are many individual ingredients that I would have trouble living without, but maybe I can choose five foods that, combined, would end up giving me all my ingredients. I would say my first food would be a green chili smothered burrito. I love those things and it gives me a bunch of the spices, like cumin, coriander, and cilantro, and staples, like beans, beef, and flour.

The next food I would choose would be Saag Paneer, which gives me a few more spices, like turmeric, and a few more staples, like spinach and cheese. The mix of spices that is &#8220;curry&#8221; is an amazing invention and I&#8217;m forever grateful to the sub-continent for this addition to my palate.

I would then try to make sure to get the rest of the new world staples that I&#8217;m missing out on. I would choose something like Moussaka, with potatoes, tomatoes, eggs, and yogurt. These are some important foods for me.

I would also like to save a large portion of Italian cuisine by sneaking a meat lovers pizza in there. This would be mainly for the spices and the different styles of cured meat often used on these pizzas. I love different types of cured meat and Italian spices are some of my favorites.

The last meal I would love would be a good Greek salad. A different type of cheese, some wonderful olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, and hot peppers. There is little that I don&#8217;t like about Greek salad.

What do you think about that?
