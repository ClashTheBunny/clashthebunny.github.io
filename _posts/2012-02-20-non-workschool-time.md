Everybody has things that they do in their spare time. I am usually listening to music if it doesn&#8217;t conflict with other things that I&#8217;m doing. This is important for me.  Parallel with that, I&#8217;m usually with <a href="http://apinchoffabric.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Joy, my beautiful wife</a>.  We are best friends and are always in the same place.  During those times with Joy and music, I will usually be learning something new, via Wikipedia or something, or I will be programming something for my computers. Computers are quite demanding pets.

Right now I&#8217;m working on getting the next version of the Internet working on my computers to get ready for <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/" target="_blank">World IPv6 Launch Day</a>. So demanding. Sub-projects involve firewalls, secure file sharing between the computers, and backups to make sure that my data is safe. When I&#8217;m not doing that, I&#8217;m working on organizing my music or revolutionizing the way I listen to music. Either mobility oriented or seamless listening has always fascinated me. I want to always have good music and I want it to follow me everywhere.   This behavior with computers is what I, and many before me, call hacking; mass media needs to learn what a hacker is and stop misusing the term.  Look on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(term)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>; there are three distinct meanings for this word.

Our dog Liza is also a big part of my free time.  She loves to take walks and loves to snuggle.  Joy and I just love dogs.

    NPR News Summary

</div>

I listen to pretty much every <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a> (Money, Tech, and Marketplace) podcast and listen to the latest <a href="http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=500005" target="_blank">NPR Hourly News Summary</a> every time I go outside.

Add in some exercise, eating, and sleeping and you have my life.

I&#8217;m trying to add in a couple of things: rock climbing (I&#8217;m going tonight to the local gym) and reading.  I used to listen to hours of <a href="http://librivox.org/" target="_blank">Librivox</a> audio books, but I&#8217;ve gotten out of the habit.  I used to rock climb quite often.  Got to get back into those.
