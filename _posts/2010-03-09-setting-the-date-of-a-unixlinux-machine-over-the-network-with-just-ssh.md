I run into machines from time to time that do not have any method of network time setting installed that I know has an incorrect date or time.<!--more-->They usually do have ssh though, so this is my solution from the host with the bad time:


  
`` sudo date `ssh <hostWithGoodClock> "date +%m%d%H%M%C%y.%S"` ``
  
or if you are doing this from a computer with ssh access to the device:
  
`ssh %lt;hostWithBadClock> "sudo date $(date +%m%d%H%M%C%y.%S)"`

Note, this has issues when it comes to time zones. Â Do this only with servers in the same timezone.
