I was sort of kidnapped today!

I spent all evening trying to get a friend&#8217;s internet working. It was midnight by the time I left, but that wasn&#8217;t a problem because buses and the metro run till 1AM. Or, so I thought! They should, but some apparently don&#8217;t make the last run of the day because of traffic, or because there wasn&#8217;t any traffic, or because the stars aren&#8217;t in alignment.

Anyhow, I wait at the bus stop for 45 minutes, and realize that there is no bus for me. And no metro. And I&#8217;m walking home&#8230;

I figure that it would have taken me like an hour and a half. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t calculate anything in my head, and I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t! I got to the first metro station from where I was and made sure that it really closes when they say they do. Which they do. But, it was a warm place and I was cold, so I warmed up and then headed back out. I made it a half a block and was &#8220;enlisted&#8221;. People know the hierarchy of strength very well here in Russia, and there is no getting out of helping somebody who asks for it. This older guy, back bent from a life of hard work, calls me over as a bus pulls up and has me help him and his 60lb. bag on a rolling cart into the bus. I&#8217;m amazed at his strength, I think he did more of the lifting than I did! Unfortunately, the doors slam shut the second we are both on the bus! This guy lured me into a trap! ðŸ™‚

I figure another warm place, heading in a not too different direction than I need to go, would be a good place to sit down and check the map and plot my next move. I come to figure out that this bus will let me off 20-30 minutes from my apartment! That&#8217;s great! I was all worried about being on some random bus that was going to make my walk longer, and yet things worked out better than I could have ever planned. A bus, that shouldn&#8217;t have been operating that late, that I had never heard of before, was exactly what I would have passed up. But it was exactly what I needed. Thanks God!
