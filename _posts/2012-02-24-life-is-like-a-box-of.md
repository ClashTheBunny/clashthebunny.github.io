Yes, chocolate.  Except that most chocolate boxes now have a nice diagram with what you can get.  This way I can avoid all of the chocolate with cherries.

I actually love most chocolate, but I will do anything with berries or nuts.  Favorites include raspberry and hazelnut.  But, what I really like is when I can just buy a whole box that is full of the same thing, and all that I like.  It&#8217;s not normally a good idea in the states, because we eat the whole box ourselves.  Here, in Bulgaria, you will always share the whole box.  Chocolate is about sharing and celebrating.  You buy the whole box the same because you love it and want to share it with others.  It&#8217;s one of the parts of Bulgarian culture that I would love to integrate into my life.
