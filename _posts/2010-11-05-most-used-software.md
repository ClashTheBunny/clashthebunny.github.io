Windows lists the most used software on your computer on its start menu.<!--more--> I was thinking about it today, and I realized that my most used software is either all in my startup folder (it starts automatically every time I start the computer) or it is a program that crashes often and needs to be restarted often. This was quite a frustrating realization for me.


  
The top two:

  * Excel
  * Internet Explorer
Thanks Windows, at least I can easily get to the programs when I need to restart them&#8230;
