I saw a blog by Harald Welte that [calls them out](http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2010/02/05#20100205-symbian_open_source){.broken_link}. I did a little digging myself and you can see links to the source code in the build logs and when you click on it, you get a big fat permission denied: &#8220;The page you are trying to access is restricted to members of the Symbian Foundation.&#8221; What&#8217;s the deal with saying that Symbian is OpenSource?!?! Bad Nokia, bad!
