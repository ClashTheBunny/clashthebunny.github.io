When I was a kid, my family time-shared a sailboat in Haiti. We didn&#8217;t get a chance to use it very often, but it was awesome experiencing it.

I was young but I still remember the thrill of the speed compared to any other water transport. I don&#8217;t know why it felt faster, but it did. I wonder if part of it was the silence combined with the speed made it feel unreal. It was also probably partly that it was an older boat and had a less fluid-dynamic hull.

It is an amazing feeling knowing that the wind is pushing you alongÂ with salty water splashing in your face on a hot day. Wonderful.

I need to ask my parents about what they can tell me about the facts of the rides on the boat.
